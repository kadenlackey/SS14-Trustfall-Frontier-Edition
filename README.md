Thank you for your interest in this still incomplete idea!

I am not a professional at leading Mafia/Werewolf/Town of Salem/Blood on the Clocktower games.
So improvements will only be discovered when playing, so I think this should be a good advice/guide section for what I do.

First off, this has inspiration from many games, and thus is not based off one specific Social Deduction game.
I am trying to keep it NT themed, but eventually I will run our of ideas for names, thus will eventually deviate from a naming convention eventually.




The ideas for a perfect party size does not exist. 
I think we should be flexible, but from what I've noticed on other games, my player count advice should lead to a fun party experience up to around 20 people. 
More than that may become a bit too hectic, but it IS possible

I set up in the Trade Mall Drama Room, but any sizeable area should be fine. 
For now I set up 15 curtains in a giant circle around  the center.

You wont catch everything, but,
You will need players to remove their ID's and put on masks in order to hide identity, to prevent a slight level of cheating.
Make sure they do not have on any personal lights. No PDA lights either. They can be seen behind the curtain and players will see the other players moving.

Roles should be distributed randomly, but I believe you should always have a DoC or Baliff in play.
In low population games, under 8 players, you might not want both, otherwise it becomes too hard as a Syndicate to win.
Same time, you might not want to put in two direct killing non-NT roles before 8 players for a similar reason, even if you have multiple Syndicate, only let one kill at a time.
If you add an NT killing role, and they kill the wrong person, that's their throw to make anyway.





Rules - Similar to other games:
Announcer has the right to silence the group, or restart the game completely.
Syndicate may only choose one target per round to kill.
Outright revealing your role via showing the role paper is cheating.
Leaving the curtain or metagaming to find a way to identify who left the curtain when, is cheating.
In real life, the dead can not speak. So the dead SHOULD NOT influence the town through speech or physical gestures.
They can talk, but any hinting at Syndicate or Neutrals should result in sitting out the next round.
In a low population game, consider Blood on the Clocktower rules, and allow them to have ONE 'guilty' vote. Keeps them engaged in playing too!






Night 0:
This phase should be used for the announcer to learn everyones roles. Write them down and remember them to prevent later confusion.
Call a role out. Confirm it. Send them back behind the curtain.
If you have multiple Syndicate members, call them all out at the same time so they can identify each other and plan accordingly.
Call out more roles than what is in play. This is to make sure players dont exactly know which roles are actually in play.
If you have a Detective, call out some of the other choices a player can be. If someone is a DoC, ask for the Paradox Clone and the Space Ninja to step out. Even if the cards arent in play.

Day 1:
Oh no! The announcer has died! There's a killer on the loose! We have to find them!
Give players time to say anything they want to say. Someone might want to fake-claim a role in this time. 
Later when a Veteran type role comes into play, someone might try to lure evils to their house while they are vested, etc.
Players cant actually vote yet, but give them time to be a bit silly, then go to Night 1.

Night 1:
The Announcer tells everyone to return to their homes/curtains
Any blocking roles should wake up, choose a target to block, then return to sleep.
The Syndicate should wake up, choose a target to kill/perform their roles on, then return to sleep.
Any Neutral roles with actions should wake up, perform their action, then return to sleep.
The Doctor should wake up, choose a target to save, then go back to sleep.
The Investigator roles should wake up, choose who to investigate, then return back to sleep.

Day 2:
Everyone wakes up. Prepare a story of what happened.
Example: 
"Last night, the Syndicate killed person A, the DoC saved the wrong person."
"Last night... the Syndicate killed person A, but the DoC worked hard and managed to save their life!"
They are not allowed to reveal their role via revealing their card, but they should be allowed to write a short Will.
They may put any information they may have gathered from this Will, but it could also be a lie!
The Announcer should allow time to discuss who the mafia might be (around 3-5 minutes)
The Announcer calls for a vote.
Only two people may be nominated for prosecution. (Two minutes for nominating)
Vote Occurs, players may abstain from voting. (Another two minutes for voting.)
If Abstains have majority vote, no one dies, otherwise the one with majority votes will die.

Cycle the Night and Day cycles until victors emerge.





Win Conditions:
Syndicate win by killing off everyone until they cant play anymore.
Example, 8 players, 2 Syndicate. The Syndicate kill 4 people, now there are 2 Syndicate, 2 NT.
The two others may be able to vote off one Syndicate, but in the next round, one of the NT will be killed, meaning the NT cant win a 1v1.

NT win by killing off all Syndicate or Evil-Aligned neutrals.
